# AI Smart Logistics – Early Delay Warning System

## Overview
AI Smart Logistics is an intelligent shipment monitoring system that predicts **shipment delays before they occur** using machine learning and real-time external data.

The system analyzes multiple factors such as **distance, weather conditions, traffic congestion, shipment medium, and carrier history** to estimate the risk of delays and suggest better routes.

It also includes **AI anomaly detection and disruption simulation** to improve logistics reliability.

## Key Features

### AI Delay Prediction
Uses **XGBoost Classifier** to predict shipment delay probability.

### Real-Time Risk Factors
The system analyzes:

- Weather conditions (OpenWeather API)
- Traffic congestion (TomTom API)
- Distance & ETA
- Carrier history
- Shipment medium (Land / Air / Water)

### AI Anomaly Detection
Detects unusual situations such as:

- Extremely long routes
- High travel time
- High delay probability

### AI Disruption Simulation
Simulates possible disruptions like:

- Weather impact
- Traffic congestion

### Smart Route Selection
Compares multiple routes and selects the **lowest risk route**.

### Interactive Map Dashboard
Uses **Folium** to generate a visual map showing:

- Shipment routes
- Origin & destination
- Delay risk heatmap

## Dataset

Dataset contains **650 logistics shipment records** including:

- Origin
- Destination
- Distance
- Weather
- Traffic
- Carrier history
- Estimated travel time
- Shipment medium (Land / Air / Water)
- Delay label

## Machine Learning Model

Algorithm used:

**XGBoost Classifier**

Why XGBoost?

- High accuracy
- Handles structured logistics data well
- Works efficiently with large datasets

## System Architecture

User Input (Shipment Details) -> Route Generation (OSRM API) -> Real-Time Data Collection(Weather API,Traffic API) -> Feature Engineering -> Machine Learning Model (XGBoost) -> Delay Risk Prediction -> AI Anomaly Detection -> Disruption Simulation -> Route Recommendation -> Map Visualization

## Interactive Map Visualization

The system generates an interactive logistics map using Folium where users can:
 - Zoom in and zoom out to explore routes across different regions.
 - View shipment routes covering multiple geographic areas.
 - Identify origin and destination points clearly on the map.
 - Visualize the shortest or most optimal route between origin and destination based on distance, traffic, and delay risk.
 - Display AI-generated route recommendations for efficient logistics planning.
 - The map is exported as an HTML dashboard, allowing users to open it in a browser and interact with the shipment routes         dynamically.

## Database Storage
All shipment records and logistics data are stored in MongoDB for efficient data management and scalability.
The system saves the following shipment details:
 - Origin city
 - Destination city
 - Route coordinates
 - Distance
 - Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
 - Delay risk probability
 - Shipment timestamp

MongoDB allows the system to:
 - Store large numbers of shipment records
 - Retrieve shipment history quickly
 - Enable future analytics on logistics performance
 - Scale easily for real-world logistics systems

 ## Future Scope
 The AI Smart Logistics system can be further enhanced with advanced technologies to improve real-world logistics operations.
 - Future improvements may include:
 Real-Time GPS Tracking
 - Integrating live GPS data from trucks or containers to monitor shipments continuously.
 IoT Sensor Integration
 - Using IoT devices to track temperature, humidity, and container conditions for sensitive shipments.
 Deep Learning Models
 - Implementing advanced neural networks for more accurate delay prediction.
 Automated Route Optimization
 - Using reinforcement learning to automatically adjust routes based on real-time disruptions.
 Logistics Company Integration
 - Connecting with logistics company databases and enterprise systems for large-scale deployment.

 ## Real-World Applications
 This system can be used in several industries:
 - E-commerce logistics (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)
 - Supply chain management
 - International cargo transport
 - Disaster relief supply logistics
 - Cold chain logistics (medical & food supply)

---
